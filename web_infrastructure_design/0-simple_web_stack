Components Explanation
What is a server?

A server is a powerful computer designed to host services, applications, and data, enabling users to access them over a network. In this case, the server at 8.8.8.8 runs the website infrastructure.
What is the role of the domain name?

The domain name (foobar.com) provides a human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). It allows users to access the website without needing to remember numerical IP addresses.
What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?

The www record is a CNAME (Canonical Name) or A (Address) record pointing to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Role of the Web Server (Nginx):

The web server handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user's browser.
It serves static files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
It forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Role of the Application Server:

The application server executes the website's backend logic.
It processes user inputs, handles business logic, and interacts with the database.
Examples: Flask, Node.js, or Java-based applications.
Role of the Database (MySQL):

The database stores and retrieves structured data (e.g., user details, product listings).
It ensures data integrity and provides efficient access to application data.
How does the server communicate with the userâ€™s computer?

The server and the user's computer communicate using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol over the internet.
The browser sends an HTTP request, and the server responds with HTML content.
