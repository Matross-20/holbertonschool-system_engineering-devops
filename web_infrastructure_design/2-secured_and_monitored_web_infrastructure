                    Monitoring Clients
                        (Sumo Logic)

Added Components Explanation
Firewalls (3 total):

Why add them? Firewalls protect the infrastructure by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic, only allowing authorized connections.
Firewall 1: Protects the load balancer from malicious external traffic.
Firewall 2: Restricts traffic between the load balancer and the web servers.
Firewall 3: Secures traffic between the web servers and the application/database layer.
SSL Certificate:

Why serve traffic over HTTPS? Encrypts communication between the user's browser and the load balancer, protecting data from eavesdropping and ensuring the authenticity of the website.
Monitoring Clients:

Why monitor? Monitoring tracks system health, detects issues, and ensures performance metrics (e.g., QPS or query-per-second) are within expected limits.
How it collects data:
Monitoring clients (e.g., for Sumo Logic) collect logs, metrics, and traces from each server (e.g., CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network traffic).
Data is aggregated in the monitoring platform for real-time analysis and alerting.
Monitoring QPS for Web Server: Configure the monitoring client to:
Track HTTP requests per second via logs or metrics (e.g., from Nginx access logs).
Aggregate and visualize this data in dashboards.
